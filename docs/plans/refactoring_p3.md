# P3 Refactoring Directions

Companion to [P1/P2 Refactoring Directions](refactoring_p1_p2.md); the ground rules there (read
`AGENTS.md`, one item per PR, relocation not redesign, test commands, updating string
architecture tests) apply to every item here and are not repeated. [`TODO.md`](../../TODO.md)
owns priorities and ordering constraints; delete each section when its item completes and the
outcome is documented.

P3 items are planned work, often alongside related changes. The module-ownership rules in
[`responsibility_visibility.md`](../aspects/responsibility_visibility.md#module-ownership) guide
the remaining UI decompositions.

## naming.implementation-files (P3 · low) {#naming-implementation-files}

46 files named `implementation.rs`. Mechanical, low risk, high navigation payoff. Per module:
`git mv` the file to a name describing what it holds (the module doc comment's first noun is
usually right — e.g. a `live_capture/implementation.rs` holding the acquisition contract impl
becomes something like `acquisition.rs`), update the `mod` declaration in the owning `mod.rs`,
touch nothing else. No visibility or re-export changes. Batch by crate (one PR per crate is
plenty); expect string architecture tests that `include_str!` a sibling by name to need the
matching one-line update. Skip any file the decomposition items above are about to dissolve —
do those last.
